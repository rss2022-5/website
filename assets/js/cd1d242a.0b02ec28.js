This weighting scheme has two main benefits. Firstly, the linear regression passively rejects outliers. The lidar module sometimes returns a distance of max_distance instead of the actual distance to an object at the reported angle. These points are given negligible weight, and so will not throw off the wall detection. The other benefit of this weighting scheme is how it responds to corners. Decreasing the weight of distant points allows the robot to look straight ahead. Points that are far away and far from the wall will also not throw off the wall detection.

Unlike other PID controllers, our group\u2019s controller is unique in that it nests two proportional controllers, not one. This mechanism prevents losing the walls on turns since the outer controller can correct errors of the inner controller.

I also learned how to use RVIZ effectively to visualize Lidar and IMU data, which will be very useful as we pursue future labs."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Quinn Bowers")," One of the biggest lessons I learned over the course of this lab was the necessity of taking clear, copious notes. I frequently found myself looking up the same linux commands. This was not too much of a challenge or use of time, but the same lesson applied to debugging; After spending multiple hours fixing the robot\u2019s connection to the joystick, I forgot a small, crucial detail and spent another several hours debugging the same issues. Having these lessons written down will help not only myself, but also democratize our progress to avoid one person knowing all the tips and tricks.\nAnother important lesson is to keep organizational frameworks as consistent as possible. We switched up our github repository structure twice (once to a new layout, then back when the TA\u2019s told us this was a bad idea), and while this did not take too much time, the back and forth made it tricky to keep everyone up-to-date on how to stay organized.\nAs a final note, I need to get better at figuring out when to pass off my knowledge and hand off tasks to others, or to just buckle down and hammer them out. I have a reasonable degree of linux experience, and often found myself scrambling to get things set up and running so others could get to work. I also have a tendency to underestimate how long tasks will take to complete. It is likely that I should be teaching these tasks to other people, to decrease my personal workload and also ensure the team is equally functional without me."),(0,r.kt)("h1",{id:"presentation"},"Presentation"),(0,r.kt)("iframe",{src:"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2Eh7WcskS73aO5SZC7rW9dOokaPHZT-3pCG_Qktys0WvX8QmcUXYEgAkbqzChheZvrAl_2brU_j69/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000",frameborder:"0",width:"960",height:"569",allowfullscreen:"true",mozallowfullscreen:"true",webkitallowfullscreen:"true"}),(0,r.kt)("h1",{id:"download-links"},"Download Links"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Briefing Slides:\n",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1K6Bw0W8B6EbHfb0qX5gAUZi1J8CbdwZb"},"Download Slides")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Report:\n",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=12nw-yAH_1OdclmKdbIHxcGwP9RZhiaW4"},"Download Report")))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},3113:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/05-f53c2944ed29866f15001f9635b9e495.png"},8007:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/1-f10d81813b3e79611603e05d56c55692.png"},993:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/10-4b73a6d3d631a63c6df5547f9d30817a.png"},3230:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/2-b4a6cdf1fb712d27da57638f82d5c742.png"},6868:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/3-3aecc300ba2cd6da43a9ee48841b7dcf.png"},6429:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/30-358eaa3cc69af4eaa842859aab6b5cc1.png"},4620:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/4-0eea3058adab9b509414478958b16dc8.png"},6985:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/5-8dcbd37c55684f64a01b7c236b1f0b50.png"},180:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/6-d1fd75f8dd326851f0b7c06d5e444e31.gif"},4592:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/7-6c112a0e0b9c250cae6510b0057a3c42.gif"},2778:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/8-fd2724439128895288b07478938162f6.png"},5658:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/mat1-2f5f772a02284d9bbeaa6a2152f6d5a9.png"},4773:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/mat2-e65aecd6241e62ab41e3ba7474ecd76d.png"},7606:function(e,a,t){a.Z=t.p+"assets/images/mat3-89f8df613537625052ee91a620149fea.png"}}]);
